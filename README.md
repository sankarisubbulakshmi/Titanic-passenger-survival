# Titanic Dataset
## Overview
The Titanic Dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of data science and machine learning. 
It provides information on the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which famously sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. 
The goal of this dataset is to predict the likelihood of a passenger surviving the disaster based on various features.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several records with 12 columns, each representing different attributes of the passengers:

### columns and their details

1. PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
2. Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
3. Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
4. Name: Name of the passenger.
5. Sex: Gender of the passenger.
6. Age: Age of the passenger (in years).
7. SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
8. Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
9. Ticket: Ticket number.
10. Fare: Passenger fare.
11. Cabin: Cabin number.
12. Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Learning Outcomes
From this dataset, we know this dataset is supervised learning Target = Survived, Target column is categorical column
